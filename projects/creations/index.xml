Automation is the only way to scale; an investment manager requires a sophisticated solution that can adapt to the ever changing business rules, and integrate efficiently into the trading workflow. Many investment managers can choose COTS, but sometimes that may not be up to the challenge to address edge cases, or evolve at the pace required by customers.</description></item><item><title>Data Architecture Modernization</title><link>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/data-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/data-architecture/</guid><description>The Data-Centric Manifesto posits that data is the center of the universe, and the trends around Data Science support the value proposition of data. Trends around adopting Data Governance is a reflection of organizations having increasingly complex data architectures, and the critical importance of quality data.

Alas, out of the box reporting leaves a lot to be desired.
This project:
Provided several reports that could be run across multiple JIRA projects so that teams may maintain multiple JIRA projects, often one per software component, yet still view a holistic report relevant for the team, project budget, or developer. Leveraged the Work Log feature in JIRA to build accurate Time Sheet reports based on actual activity spent on issues leading to more accurate time sheets and less administrative burden.</description></item><item><title>Enterprise Technical Architecture Program</title><link>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/architecture/</guid><description>Why Enterprise Architecture?
