instrumented code to identify how long certain steps were taking âŒš optimized code so that it would run faster ðŸš€ added features to avoid costly, redundant downloads of the National Vulnerability Database saving several minutes during builds All resulted in making it easier to integrate into a CI/CD pipeline and thus promoting adoption, leading to greater awareness of vulnerabilities and more secure solutions.</description></item></channel></rss>
