Provided several reports that could be run across multiple JIRA projects so that teams may maintain multiple JIRA projects, often one per software component, yet still view a holistic report relevant for the team, project budget, or developer. Leveraged the Work Log feature in JIRA to build accurate Time Sheet reports based on actual activity spent on issues leading to more accurate time sheets and less administrative burden.</description></item><item><title>Production Control</title><link>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/production-control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/production-control/</guid><description>Many enterprises have thousands of automated jobs that run throughout the day and into the night that are critical to business operations.
