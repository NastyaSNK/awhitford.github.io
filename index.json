Alas, out of the box reporting leaves a lot to be desired.\nThis project:\n Provided several reports that could be run across multiple JIRA projects so that teams may maintain multiple JIRA projects, often one per software component, yet still view a holistic report relevant for the team, project budget, or developer. Leveraged the Work Log feature in JIRA to build accurate Time Sheet reports based on actual activity spent on issues leading to more accurate time sheets and less administrative burden. Encouraged appropriate use of JIRA using gamification resulting in teams adopting best practices and accurate reports.  Other benefits included:\n Reports were used as an historical record, useful for SDLC artifacts, discussions with business sponsors, and performance reviews. Sprint planning and monitoring across related JIRA projects were dramatically easier, enabling agile to scale. Related JIRA issues, such as dependencies, were highlighted raising awareness and helping ensure the success of resolving issues.
