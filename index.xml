Automation is the only way to scale; an investment manager requires a sophisticated solution that can adapt to the ever changing business rules, and integrate efficiently into the trading workflow. Many investment managers can choose COTS, but sometimes that may not be up to the challenge to address edge cases, or evolve at the pace required by customers.</description></item><item><title>Data Architecture Modernization</title><link>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/data-architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/data-architecture/</guid><description>The Data-Centric Manifesto posits that data is the center of the universe, and the trends around Data Science support the value proposition of data. Trends around adopting Data Governance is a reflection of organizations having increasingly complex data architectures, and the critical importance of quality data. Organizations require comprehensive capabilities and processes around data; the DMBOK Wheel summarizes the challenges.
This project:
Hired dedicated Data Architects to help lead the data architecture modernization initiative Rationalized feedback with DMBOK to develop vision, do a gap analysis, and prioritize Partnered with the new Enterprise Data team to promote Data Governance Explored new solutions, conducted proof of concepts, and purchased new capabilities Established a Community of Practice for Data Architecture to communicate new capabilities, best practices, and discuss challenges Benefits included:</description></item><item><title>Enterprise DevOps Pipeline</title><link>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/devops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/devops/</guid><description>DevOps is an important cultural shift that breaks down barriers between development and operations allowing organizations to create and improve solutions efficiently using automated processes. The Enterprise DevOps Pipeline was a uniform, automated process of transforming source code changes into delivered solutions.
This project:
Introduced new tools, such as GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Vault, Splunk, Ansible, and Terraform Created a DevOps Community of Practice to aid adoption Promoted best practices, such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Secrets Management, and the Twelve Factors Provided more flexibility to developers for crafting solutions, while providing transparency to operations through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Supported a variety of technology platforms (Java, JavaScript, Python, Scala, etc.</description></item><item><title>Enterprise JIRA Reporting</title><link>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/jira-reporting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/jira-reporting/</guid><description>JIRA is a great issue tracking system and can be really critical for agile teams. Alas, out of the box reporting leaves a lot to be desired.
This project:
Provided several reports that could be run across multiple JIRA projects so that teams may maintain multiple JIRA projects, often one per software component, yet still view a holistic report relevant for the team, project budget, or developer. Leveraged the Work Log feature in JIRA to build accurate Time Sheet reports based on actual activity spent on issues leading to more accurate time sheets and less administrative burden.</description></item><item><title>Enterprise Technical Architecture Program</title><link>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/architecture/</guid><description>Why Enterprise Architecture? Organizations of sufficient size and complexity need to organize themselves to make smart decisions, foster innovation, and avoid being overburdened by technical debt.
This program:
Engaged Gartner Consulting to outline a modern Enterprise Architecture framework that focused on coaching and steering Established a Technical Architecture Committee with cross IT representation as a decision-making body that improved management of innovation and technical debt, and communicated standards Documented a Technical Reference Architecture, a living document that included guardrails (Principles, Patterns, and Standards) for teams Created a Center of Excellence to gather feedback from teams and help prioritize evolution Organized guest speakers and Lunch and Learns to raise awareness of industry trends Benefits included:</description></item><item><title>Flutter Form Builder</title><link>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/contributions/flutter_form_builder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/contributions/flutter_form_builder/</guid><description>Flutter Form Builder is an innovative Flutter package that helps creating and managing forms in Flutter. It simplifies form management:
reduces the boilerplate needed to build forms validates fields reacts to changes collects the values for the form I am a top collaborator on this project and was instrumental in its version 4 release. I increased type safety, test coverage, and consistency with the Flutter framework. Overall, I help make this project better.</description></item><item><title>Kozzet</title><link>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/kozzet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://AnthonyWhitford.com/projects/creations/kozzet/</guid><description>People love the convenience of mobile ordering at home, but what about when they are away from home?
